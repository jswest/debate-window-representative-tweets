brag about not paying did crooked hillary clinton pay any income taxes in 2015 or did she pay taxes on this cash pays no federal taxes but creates huge new federal entitlement for us to pay f hillary pays more in taxes but 50m for air fare foundation and co paid most back in campaign contributions way to wash the money new york times publishes tax returns of a private citizen in shallow attempt to assist hillary via hillary just dunked like nine times on the issue of donald not releasing his tax returns our taxes pay to maintain the streets the power lines the plumbing etc that lead to properties while he pays nothing hey rudy giuliani you know who does pay taxes bill and hillary clinton hillary said she knows plenty of rich ppl that want to pay more taxes to help this economythen tell the idiots to write a check its your duty to pay taxes its your duty to legally file pays as little as possible also i will release my tax returns when hillary releases her 33000 deleted emails i dont pay taxes because im smart i pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes but hillary is two faced cuz honest abe missed opportunity he shouldve said hell release his tax returns when hillary
